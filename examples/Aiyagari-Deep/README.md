# Aiyagari Model - Deep Learning based Algorithm

We solve Aiyagri model with Poisson income process with a neural network. 

The pertinent file for step-by-step illustration is "Aiyagari-Deep_Poisson.ipynb".

For results only, 
1. Set current directory as working directory with "cd ./examples/Aiyagari-Deep/"
2. Install necessary packages with "pip install -r ./binder/requirement.txt" 
3. Execute training process and generate the graphs with "python Aiyagari-Deep_Poisson.py" (It takes around 4 minutes to finish training)
