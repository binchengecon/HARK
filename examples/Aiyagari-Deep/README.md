# Aiyagari Model - Deep Learning based Algorithm

We solve Aiyagri model with Poisson income process with a neural network.  (It takes around 4 minutes to finish training)

The pertinent file for step-by-step illustration is "Aiyagari-Deep_Poisson.ipynb".

For results only, run the following commands
1. Set current directory as working directory with 
* cd ./examples/Aiyagari-Deep/
2. Install necessary packages with 
* pip install -r ./binder/requirement.txt
3. Execute training process and generate the graphs with 
* python Aiyagari-Deep_Poisson.py


Or simply execute 

* ./reproduce.sh
