# Aiyagari Model - Deep Learning based Algorithm

We solve Aiyagri model with Poisson income process with a neural network. 

The pertinent file for step-by-step illustration is "Aiyagari-Deep_Poisson.ipynb".

For results only, 
1. Make "./HARK/examples/Aiyagari-Deep/" the current working directory
2. Execute command in terminal or command window "python Aiyagari-Deep_Poisson.py"
